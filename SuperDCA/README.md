# SuperDCA

## About

SuperDCA is a tool for global direct couplings analysis (DCA) of input genome alignments. SuperDCA implements the pseudo-likelihood maximization DCA algorithm (plmDCA) in a fairly efficient manner and is capable of inferring parameters for genome alignments with at least up to 10^5 loci significant loci and thousands of samples.
