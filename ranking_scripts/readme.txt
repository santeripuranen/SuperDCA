 An R-function for phylogenetic ranking of the couplings****************************************************************This script can be used for re-ranking the top SuperDCA couplings in order to single out potentially interesting epistatic interactions from a background of strong but trivial couplings due to linkage disequilibrium (LD).INPUTS:**********The function requires the following inputs:coups = list of couplings above the threshold selected by cumulative coupling value distribution: 1st column is the estimated coupling value, 2nd and 3rd columns coupled SNPs mapped to full ength genome, 4th and 5th columns are coupled SNPs mapped to filtered fasta generated by SuperDCABAPS = hierBAPS clusters: 1st column is the lane ID, second column is the level 1 hierBAPS clusterfilt.fasta = filtered fasta file generated by SuperDCAOUTPUTS:*************The function outputs a data file including original columns of “coups” along with computed ranking criteria and a variable giving the new phylogenetic rank of each coupling.USAGE:**********# requires library Biostringslibrary(Biostrings)source(phyl.ranking.function.R)ranking <- phyl.ranking(coups, BAPS, filt.fasta)head(ranking$coups.ranked)
